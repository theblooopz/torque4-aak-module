- motion shadow update rotation issue - possibly new camera class isn't triggering a rotate event so it's not updating the shadows when you move around (https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1836/files)
- [maybe fixed?] sometimes the probes don't load and the shadows are super dark
- UI module doesn't load settings properly (and/or doesn't save them properly)
- HDR postfx filter is busted so it washes out colors and makes it gray
- physics plugins cause sliding and going up slope friction issues for AAK character
- SFXEnvironments not working
- script asset dependency not working
- some non-metallic materials look metallic in shadows
- UI audio volume levels don't work, mouse link sensitivity doesn't work, etc.
- [fixed] if I change stuff in static object materials in tools and save and press play it screws up the entire scene where nothing loads
- data/fontCache - needs to be the directory defined in core profile whatever
